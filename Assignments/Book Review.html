    <p>A Suitable Boy is a novel by Vikram Seth, published in 1993. With 1,349 pages , 
        the English-language book is one of the longest novels published in a single volume.<b>A Suitable Boy is set in a
         newly post-independence, post-partition India.</b></p>
         <p></p>The book is about the ordinary family life of four families, things like sibling
          relationships, romantic relationships and marriage, and friendship across families and religions; but on a bigger scale, 
          it also looks at religious unrest, social and political changes in the wider society, like the happenings in the parliament

    The novel follows four families during 18 months, and centres on Mrs. Rupa Mehra's efforts to arrange the marriage of her younger daughter, 
    Lata, to a "suitable boy". Lata is a 19-year-old university student who refuses to be influenced by her domineering mother or opinionated brother, Arun. Her story revolves

<p><b> Novels like A Suitable Boy confound the one-dimensionality of a 5-star rating system and 
    leave me stymied. This is a 5-star novel.</b></p>
