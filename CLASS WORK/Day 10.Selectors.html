    <p id="class">Education-focused content is content that is created by educators to engage, inspire and inform their students. Gone are the days when students learned from only a textbook and a lecture. Educational content is something that can be creative and personalized to each learner’s needs.

        As a whole, educational content is versatile, accessible, informational, and should be created in a manner that helps you achieve your student’s learning goals.
        
        For example, educational content can be helpful for teaching students of all ages the same topic and story. Say a mother and a son are learning English for the first time, and you want to teach them about English sentence structure and grammar phrases. You can easily modify your lesson plan for the young son to learn your lesson by creating an interactive game.</p>
